# Advent of Code 2020

Solutions of the [AoC2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

The code for each problem can be run using

```bash
python main.py <problem_number>
```

for instance

```bash
python main.py 10
```

Except for the problem 19, no extra dependencies are required, all the other problems are solved with the Python standard library.

Problem 19 needs the `regex` package, because `re` does not handle recursive pattern. It can be installed with:
```bash
pip install regex
```
